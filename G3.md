# Low Fidelity Prototype
Team Currently In Progress! : Jasmine Chi, Yitong Shan, Shreya Sathyanarayanan

## Prototype Components
What are the components?
The components of our low-fidelity prototype are a Discord server with channels for each of the tasks that Prioritize Bot, our Discord “Bot”, will be performing. We created three different channels, #keyword-user-notifications, #notification-alarms, and #bookmarks. The tasks of the Discord “Bot” were performed by one of our team members, who sent messages introducing the bot and possible message responses based on the commands that users can type.

Keyword Notifications: Users can use the Discord “Bot” to set specific keywords that they want to keep track of in Discord messages to help them prioritize their notifications. Users can view the messages with the specific keywords in the #keyword-user-notifications channel. The Discord “Bot” also provides users with the ability to keep track of messages where the users were mentioned using @[username].

Notification Alarms: Users can use the Discord “Bot” to set alarms on a message to help remind them to respond. Users can view the messages with notification alarms in the #notification-alarms channel. The user can specify a day and time for the alarm to deliver a reminder to respond to the message. Users can also add a comment to be displayed in the response reminder message when setting the notification alarm. The response reminder message can be viewed in the #notification-alarms channel.

Bookmarks: Users can use the Discord “Bot” to bookmark messages from specific users to view later, receive notification summaries from specific channels, and view reminder updates which appear when a user has responded to a message after setting a notification alarm. All bookmarked messages, channel notification summaries, and reminder updates can be viewed in the #bookmarks channel. The concept of the #bookmarks channel is to provide one place where users can view saved content and updates.

## Wizardry Aspects of Our Prototype

For the wizardry parts of our prototype, one of our group members will act as the “bot” and type the message out. Certain features such as finding keywords, summarizing a channel, and notification alarms are wizardry and we’re manually doing all of these things rather than having a bot actually do it.
