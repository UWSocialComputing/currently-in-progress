## Overview of Project Direction and Target Audience
In the digital age, particularly among college students and young adults, smartphone usage is a key aspect of daily life. With the increasing reliance on mobile technology and social media for both personal and academic purposes, it is crucial to understand how smartphone notifications and chat apps affect the productivity of students, sense of community, and overall perceptions of online interactions. While smartphone apps and social media offer unprecedented connectivity and convenience, they also present challenges such as notification overload, potential miscommunication in online spaces, and impacts on mental well-being with always having to feel “on” and “connected”. 

Our target audience is college students and young adults and our main focus is to understand and enhance notification management and explore how interactions with notifications and chat experiences impact productivity and the sense of feeling overwhelmed.

## Methodology
We wanted to learn more about how young adults interact with notifications and their sense of connectivity and community when using chat spaces. The research methods we have chosen to conduct our user research are semi-structured interviews and a survey. Our survey included questions about phone notifications and productivity and questions about experiences using chat apps and included a variety of question types, including multiple-choice, Likert Scale, and open-ended questions. We found the topics of notifications and chat app interactions to be connected and asking questions about both areas helped us learn about a wider range of experiences. The survey helped us obtain general information from our target audience of college students and young adults and helped us look for any notable patterns in how people manage their notifications and engage with messaging platforms. 

The semi-structured interviews helped us get a deeper understanding of the personal views of our target audience and their ideas about our topic. We conducted 3 in-person interviews to gather in-depth insights into the notification management habits of college students. We started each interview by asking about the participants’ general experiences and attitudes towards phone notifications and we had a slight mix of both positive and negative aspects of their responses which helped set a balanced tone for our later discussion. Afterward, we delved deeper into how participants manage and interact with the notifications on their phones, such as prioritization of notifications, reactions to multiple notifications, and strategies used to manage them. We explored the types of apps that most frequently send notifications and how these impacted their daily routines as well as the overall effectiveness of various tools and features (such as Do Not Disturb, app notification settings) in managing notifications. We thought that having semi-structured interviews would help capture the varying and nuanced opinions that participants have regarding notification management beyond the responses from the survey. While specific technical details of each app or device were not exactly the primary focus, we wanted to instead focus on the personal stories and experiences with notifications with this user research method.

## Participants/Data
We have in total 31 respondents to our survey, with 29 undergrad students and 2 grad students. All responses are anonymous. 64.5% of participants answered “Yes” and 25.8% of participants answered “Sometimes” to the survey question “Do notifications get lost for you? Do you sometimes forget to do something because the notification is gone?”. We wanted to dig deeper and gain more insights by conducting interviews.

The 3 participants we interviewed in-person were college students (ages 18-22) who used many (3+) different messaging platforms in their day-to-day lives. Many of the participants brought up having an internal prioritization system but no actual prioritization on their phones. Generally, notifications were thought of in two piles which were “answer immediately” or “read now but leave for later”.

Our surveys and interviews brought up the idea that young adults seem to be interrupted by phone notifications. Some key questions we asked in our interviews and surveys were:
- How overwhelmed do you feel with app notifications?
- What is your first impulse when receiving notifications?
- Do you have any ways of prioritizing notifications on your phone?
- What might cause you not to respond to a message?
- In what ways do you think chat apps can be improved to facilitate more connectivity and build community beyond sending and receiving text messages?

## AEIOU Findings
### Activities: 
In many users’ experiences, when they receive a notification, they either immediately respond to it or read it and then leave it for later to respond if it is not urgent. Most participants lose track of their notifications and sometimes forget a task, such as responding to someone or logging into an app because the notification is lost. The most frequently used apps are iMessage, Discord, and Instagram. Most of the responses for improvements to chat spaces have some multi-platform features or request new features that encourage interactions and reminders to respond.

The goal of using reminder tools is for students to manage tasks, schedule, stay organized, and improve efficiency and we wanted to learn about user patterns in the context of keeping track of notifications. Most participants use notes (58.1%) and calendars (58.1%) as apps to keep track of their to-dos, while only 12.9% of the respondents do not use such apps, which shows that most college students rely on technology or physical notes for task management and organization. 
### Environments:
Our focus was on the digital environment in which users use their phones to manage their notifications. We surveyed users on their frequently used messaging apps, the ways in which they manage and prioritize their notifications, their general feelings about notifications, and the way that they engage and interact with others on messaging platforms.

### Interactions:
We found that users perform a variety of interactions when receiving notifications on their phones. Many of these interactions are from how users react to notifications appearing on their screens. Here are some common types of interactions survey participants noted: 
- Reading notifications
- Opening the apps that the notifications are from
- Clearing notifications
- Swiping down notifications
- Responding to notifications
- Ignoring notifications
- Checking if a notification is urgent
- Checking to see what app the notification is from or who the notification is from

### Objects:
The messaging platforms that users use to interact with others and receive notifications include iMessage, Discord, Instagram, WeChat, Slack, etc. We also studied how users engage with the notification banners and alerts from the apps and platforms to communicate with others. On how chat apps can be improved to foster more connectivity and building community, some users suggest a "remind me later" feature and increased personalization and organization, like features akin to a multifunctional platform (setting status, organizing chat spaces for different purposes like discord), and functionalities with user accessibility. 
Users:
The majority of individuals surveyed were college students aged between 19-23. This demographic selection is particularly relevant given that these young adults have been raised in the era of smartphones and social media and they tend to have an increased tendency to engage with these technologies daily compared to older generations.

### Takeaways
As we were interviewing, we noticed that participants tend to have different ways in which they prioritize their notifications. In many cases, they saw the notifications but decided that they were too busy to respond at the moment and would come back another time. The level of urgency of the notifications and who they were from was also a large factor in how they prioritized these notifications.

The interviewees also mentioned that they enjoyed having reactions such as on Discord, a platform with many different reactions available. An interesting thing discussed was that these reactions made it feel easier sometimes to not respond to a message and instead just use a reaction. Rather than giving the sense that your messages are left read, the reaction soothes the feeling of “you have to respond” of the person reacting and also gives a more “positive” signal to the person who sent the message.

Based on participants’ interactions with notifications, we could further explore how banners, alerts, and the design of how notifications are displayed can make notifications less of an interruption and more prioritized and further explore the combination of chat apps and notification reminders.
